          <h2>Local SEO Projects</h2>
          <p>
            The first style you may be familiar with, and for many of you this
            is the reason you are here, is Local SEO. Local SEO is the process
            of ranking a business high in local maps search results to get
            customers from the immediate surrounding area. As Google has evolved
            this has gone from ranking pages on a website with that location
            information (if only one location then even the homepage) to today
            when Google Maps is boss and getting into the 3-pack on Page 1 is
            key to successful local SEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            t’s best to think about Local SEO like Google is a local referral
            business. Customers, or searchers, use the business to find what
            they need. Like “Hey Google, who’s the best plumber in this area?”.
            These days with voice search, Google Assistant, etc – that could be
            a real search query.
          </p>
          <p>
            How would a real person act in this situation? If I have lived in
            the area for 30 years, I have probably used a plumber or two. As a
            referral business maybe I’ve looked up 10 of the best plumbers in
            the area and researched them a bit. Which plumber would I refer to
            you? Someone with a ton of great reviews and a website that I can
            send you to, confident you will easily find the information you are
            looking for? Or someone with a sketchy website and no customer
            reviews, so on and so forth. Someone that shares interesting
            plumbing tips on YouTube every week? Or someone that has no social
            posts since 2014?
          </p>
          <p>You get the point.</p>
          <p>
            In reality, the person with the sketchy website may be the better
            plumber, but they will lose the customer every time because from the
            outside looking in they look less trustworthy, and that single word
            is the whole point of Local SEO. Making YOUR business the one that
            Google refers to. You have the most reviews. You have weekly or at
            least regular fresh content coming out. You are consistently
            improving your website to make it more user-friendly and
            informative.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Slow website? Not a good user experience for their customers
              (“searchers”). Google is not going to refer you.
            </li>
            <li>
              No new content for years? Your information is probably out of
              date. Google is not going to refer you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrong business information out there? Not trustworthy if your
              website has one phone number and Yelp has another. Google is not
              going to refer you.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            What can you do to 100% ensure that your website or business is the
            one that Google refers to? What could be done to make it impossible
            for them to deny that your business is the one that should be #1?
            You will NOT let down their customers (“searchers”) with a bad
            experience. You have created such a trustworthy appearance and
            presence online that they rank you #1 with confidence and you
            deliver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The list is fairly extensive, and after the basics, there are always
            more things you can do to build your “online empire”. We would be
            happy to set up a consultation with you to discuss further.

            <h2>Organic (National) SEO Projects</h2>
            <p>
              Organic SEO takes the same concepts as Local SEO but now instead
              of focusing on locally targeted searches we can get more traffic
              from search by ranking for keywords and queries that are not
              specific to a location. So instead of “best bakery near me”
              someone searches for “how to make gluten-free cupcakes”.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your business can provide services or products to customers
              anywhere then organic SEO can be a great strategy to exponentially
              grow your website traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, for this type of campaign, the strategy does change a
              bit. A lot of the rankings will come from quality content and not
              just “trustworthiness”. Reviews and location information like
              name, address, and phone number do not matter so much. A great
              article that fully answers a searcher’s question does.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of trying to dominate search results for the hundred or so
              local variations of your service keywords (best Charlotte SEO
              company, SEO company near me, SEO services nearby, highly rated
              SEO company…) you have the opportunity for almost “unlimited”
              traffic through long-tail keywords. Like “how do I set up a new
              WordPress website to rank well on Google?” or “what are the best
              WordPress SEO plugins to use on my website?”. Each new web page
              you create is a ranking asset and when you suddenly have 100+
              ranking assets after a year of solid SEO work life is good.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Long-tail keywords are “unpopular” (i.e., low Volume) and
                highly-focused search queries that tend to convert exceptionally
                well.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            [Link to Ahrefs https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/]
            <ol>
              <li>
                Slow website? Not a good user experience for their customers
                (“searchers”). Google is not going to refer you.
              </li>
              <li>

                Wrong business information out there? Not trustworthy if your
                website has one phone number and Yelp has another. Google is not
                going to refer you.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              How to take advantage of this? It starts with research.
              Specifically, keyword research to find the hundreds if not
              thousands of topics that could be discussed on your website. Then
              competitor research to see what companies are already attacking
              those keywords. One thing to understand at this point is that
              there are many companies out there who have been doing this for
              many years. They have a leg up and an advantage. But those
              companies may also have older slower websites or be ranking for
              keywords just because they haven’t had any competition yet. If
              your website is better, and your content is better, you can win.
            </p>
            <p>
              Armed with keywords and competitor information, next we create a
              monthly strategy to write and publish fresh and interesting
              content on your website. Content that ranks well is long (1000
              words or more) and fully answers a specific topic or question.
              “Thin content”, pages with less than 500 words, will not only NOT
              rank well anymore but in some cases hurt your overall website. We
              want to flush out pages completely and create some true assets
              that will rank for years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second piece of organic SEO is earned media or “backlinks”. In
              today’s search landscape, the algorithms are extremely smart so
              this section does not just cover actual links, as it has for many
              years, but also things like brand mentions. That’s a lot of
              technical jargon so below we explain both things.
            </p>
            <h2>What are backlinks?</h2>
            <p>
              A “backlink” is an actual link on someone else’s website that
              leads to your website. If you have a Yelp listing for your
              business that has your address and phone number and then also you
              filled in your website URL so people can click over to your actual
              website, <strong>that is a backlink</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a rock climbing equipment eCommerce store and someone
              else has a popular rock climbing blog and they post a review of a
              product you carry and link to your product page in the article,
              <strong>that is a backlink</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you write an awesome blog post about how to change the oil in
              your car and someone else is writing an article called “10 Things
              to Learn This Year To Make You A Better Car Owner” and #3 is learn
              to change their oil and they find your in-depth, step-by-step,
              write up they include a link to that for their readers. They are
              not trying to teach that skill themselves, but they enhance their
              article by providing a link to a great resource to learn -

              In the section above we wanted to define “long-tail keywords”
              without needing to write our 2,000-word article, so we looked for
              a trusted website that had an article fully explaining the
              subject, grabbed a little snippet of text and included a button to
              the full blog - <strong>that is a backlink (for them!)</strong>{" "}

              These days earning backlinks through creating awesome content is
              the truest form of “white hat SEO”. However, that can take YEARS.
              So, the happy medium is working with an experienced agency that
              has the connections and know-how to nudge specific bloggers and
              website owners towards your content. We organically reach out
              either to bloggers we have worked with in the past or new people
              we discover through researching your niche and point them in the
              direction of your great resource (article, infographic, video,
              blog post, etc.)

            <h2>What is Technical SEO?</h2>
            <p>
              Technical SEO has to do with the actual technology that runs your
              website along with the code of your website. Many people confuse
              “on-page SEO” with technical SEO when they are not the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              On-page optimization refers to making sure your content is
              correctly optimized for search engines to understand. This means
              your keywords are in the right spot, your images are named
              correctly, and you have 20+ other elements correct on a page by
              page basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technical optimization, on the other hand, refers more to things
              like how fast your website loads, is your website protected by SSL
              certificate, etc. During a Technical SEO audit, our team looks at
              the hardware and software running your website. Sure that GoDaddy
              hosting price looks inviting but when you are on an old server
              with limited RAM and running PHP 5.4 then your website will never
              perform up to its full capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hosting, and especially WordPress hosting needs to be technically
              “up to snuff” for your website to perform it’s best. If your
              competition is running PHP 7.3 and has advanced caching in place
              along with other server optimizations and you are chugging along
              on GoDaddy shared plan then you need to rethink your strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our technical SEO audit is geared towards established regional
              websites, eCommerce websites, or SaaS startup site and runs
              through a myriad of checks both software-driven and manual to
              ensure any future organic SEO campaigns you may embark on can get
              you the most success possible.

                WordPress is built using the PHP programming language. We are
                PHP experts and have 10+ years of experience creating PHP
                snippets and code that helps your website rank.

                We understand the technology and software it takes to run a

                WordPress has a huge plugin ecosystem to pretty much do anything
                you want. Not only have we created our WordPress plugins, but we
                have used and tested hundreds of the most popular. We can advise
                on which to use, which to avoid, or even write some custom code
                so you get the same benefit but can delete a plugin. The more
                plugins you have installed the slower your site typically runs.

                We install and set up WordPress SEO plugins and include the PRO

                We study and stay up on the latest WordPress trends. When new
                versions come out we understand the changes and implement
                quickly. We test out, try, and review almost all new products in
                the WordPress world. We write articles and post on social media
                about it. We share what we learn in our WordPress group Better
                WordPress Habits. In short, you can say we are WordPress
                obsessed and this bodes well for your WordPress SEO.
